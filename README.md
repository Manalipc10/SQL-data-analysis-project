# SQL-data-analysis-project 
--
## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how SQL alone can be used as a **complete data analytics and business intelligence engine** — without relying on external BI tools.
Each SQL script in this repository solves a **specific real-world business problem**, ranging from exploratory analysis to advanced performance and segmentation reporting.
It utilizes a star-schema warehouse with three tables: `fact_sales`, `dim_customers`, and `dim_products`.


## 🎯 Project Goals
- Apply **advanced SQL concepts** (CTEs, window functions, subqueries, joins) to analyze large datasets.
- Simulate a **real business intelligence workflow** — from data exploration to executive insights.
- Demonstrate how to translate **business questions into analytical SQL logic**.

## ⚙️ Techniques Used
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** for query modularity and readability
- **Window Functions** for ranking, cumulative sums, and moving averages
- **Joins & Subqueries** for multi-table integration
- **Aggregation & Grouping** for business KPI generation
- **Parameterized Filters** for flexible scenario analysis
